# Notification-Component

This is for getting notifications from notification-api onto the screen.  It is assumed eventually it will be added to the o-app-header and show a bell at the top of the header bar with a number of notifications it has brought in.

# Building
```
	npm install
	bower install
	webpack
```

All files will be built into the lib folder.  As of right now because i don't feel like dealing with webpack-dev-server you can test this component by opening up index.html in any browser.
